# drop-project

Learning as much as I can within a short time frame, developed and presented a geo-location image sharing app, with mentoring from developers at Commonwealth Bank. 
Designed and built with the Model, View, Presenter (MVP) architecture. Utilised Google Play Services, Google Maps and various other libraries.
